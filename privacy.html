  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: June 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Discord bot ("the Bot") collects and uses data.</p>

  <h2>Data Collected</h2>
  <p>The Bot stores configuration data such as role IDs, channel IDs, and team assignments. This data is saved in server-local configuration files and not shared with any third parties.</p>

  <h2>Usage Logs</h2>
  <p>The Bot may store usage statistics (e.g. how many screenshots are approved per team). This is only used for event tracking and is not shared externally.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to secure stored configuration data, but we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, contact the server administrators or the bot owner directly via Discord.</p>
